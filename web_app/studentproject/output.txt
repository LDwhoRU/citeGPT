The present report highlights the relevance of Self-Determination Theory (SDT), specifically the subtheory of Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET), for creating effective AI-based educational tools that promote students' intrinsic motivation. The SDT conceptualizes human beings as innately driven to grow and integrate their personality, which fuels their self-motivation. According to Ryan and Deci (2000), the CET emphasizes the importance of social-contextual factors that facilitate intrinsic motivation, particularly for competence and autonomy needs. The report argues that ChatGPT, an AI tool, can enhance students' academic outcomes by addressing these fundamental needs.

To illustrate, ChatGPT can offer students personalized support, enabling them to work at their own pace and explore their interests. This feature is aligned with the need for autonomy, defined as a sense of volition and self-determination (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Additionally, ChatGPT can provide instant feedback, suggestions, and resources, promoting a sense of competence, defined as the experience of efficacy and effectiveness in one's activities (Ryan & Deci, 2000). This feedback can enhance students' confidence, leading to improved academic performance and motivation.

Furthermore, ChatGPT has the potential to facilitate relatedness needs, defined as the desire to establish connections with others (Ryan & Deci, 2000). The tool can enable group projects, fostering collaboration and a sense of belongingness. This social contextual support can enhance students' intrinsically motivated activities, but it is also essential that the activity itself holds intrinsic interest for the students (Ryan & Deci, 2000).

By leveraging the SDT and CET, educational technology designers can create AI-based tools that promote students' long-term growth and well-being, beyond mere academic outcomes. Additionally, these theories offer a robust framework to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools, ensuring they genuinely enhance intrinsic motivation and positive experiences for students. Therefore, integrating these concepts into AI-based educational tools can contribute to creating a generation of self-motivated, autonomous, and competent learners.
