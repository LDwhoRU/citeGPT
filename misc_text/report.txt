Self-Determination Theory is all about what makes people tick and how that affects our personal growth and happiness. It's based on three big ideas: feeling in control, getting better at stuff, and connecting with others. As a basketball coach, I've seen how giving players choices, helping them improve, and letting them bond with teammates made them more excited and play better.

So, what if we use this idea to see how AI tools like ChatGPT can help students? We want to know how ChatGPT can make learning better and help students stop putting things off, and how to make their time using it even more awesome.

Using this theory, we can see how ChatGPT might give students what they need. For example, it can help them feel in control by giving personalized support, so they can work at their own pace and explore what interests them. It can also help them get better at challenging tasks by giving instant feedback, suggestions, and resources, boosting their confidence. Plus, AI tools can help students connect with others in group projects, making it easier for them to work together and feel like they're part of something.

What's cool about this theory is that it focuses on what really drives people from the inside, which is super important for long-term success and happiness. By understanding what students need, we can make AI-based educational tools that get them excited, more productive, and help them stop procrastinating. This idea also helps us check if these tools are really making a difference in students' motivation and happiness, making sure they're actually making education better.
