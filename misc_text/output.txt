The Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is an approach to human motivation and personality that emphasizes the significance of humans' inherent psychology for personality development and behavioral self-regulation (Ryan & Deci, 2000). SDT focuses on individuals' built-in growth tendencies and innate psychological needs, which include competence, relatedness, and autonomy. These needs are essential for optimal functioning, constructive social development, and personal well-being. 

An important issue in the field of psychology is intrinsic motivation, which is the inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, extend and exercise one's capacities, explore, and learn (Ryan & Deci, 2000). SDT specifies social-contextual events that facilitate, rather than undermine, intrinsic motivation, assuming that intrinsic motivation is an inborn propensity that will be catalyzed when individuals are in conditions that conduce towards its expression. 

By utilizing SDT, we can see how AI tools like ChatGPT could be used to enhance learning and improve students' motivation. By giving students access to personalized support and allowing them to work at their own pace and explore what interests them, ChatGPT can help them feel in control, thereby contributing to their intrinsic motivation. Additionally, instant feedback, suggestions, and resources can help students get better at challenging tasks, ultimately boosting their confidence, and motivation. AI tools can also promote group work, making it easier for students to connect with others and feel a sense of belonging. 

What makes SDT cool is its focus on understanding what drives people from the inside, which is crucial for long-term success and happiness. By understanding what students need to succeed, we can develop AI-based educational tools that are specifically tailored to their needs, increasing excitement, productivity, and decreasing procrastination. Ultimately, this approach helps to ensure that these tools are actually making a difference in students' motivation and happiness, among other things, ultimately making education better, and perhaps even more effective.
